			Apart from academics I also try to put forth a lot of effort in maintaining my physical health to my best. Sometimes apart from academics one should also go for physical fitness or should approach his hobbies. The following are the activities which I like to do in my free time in order to atleast develop some awareness about things apart from academics:
			<ul class="ecu-list">
				<li>Lawn Tennis</li>
				<li>Solving different types of Rubik's</li>
				<li>Reading Novels</li>
				<li>Photoshop</li> 
				<li>PC Gaming</li> 
			</ul>
